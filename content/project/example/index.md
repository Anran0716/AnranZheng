The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has been spreading among New York State since March 2020, posing health and socioeconomic threat to many regions. Statistics of daily confirmed cases and deaths in this region had been growing and declining amid changing policies and environ-mental factors. Based on the county-level COVID-19 cases and environmental influencing factors in New York State from March to December 2020, this study investigated spatiotemporal clus-tering patterns using spatial autocorrelation and spatiotemporal scanning. Environmental factors influencing the COVID-19 spreading were analyzed based on the Geodetector method. Infection clusters first appeared in southern New York State and then moved to the central western parts as the epidemic developed. The statistical results of spatiotemporal scanning are consistent with those of spatial autocorrelation analysis. The analysis results of the Geodetector showed that both temperature and population density had the strongest explanations for the monthly incidence of COVID-19, especially in March and April, 2020. There is a trend of increasing interaction between various risk factors. This study explored the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 in New York State over ten months and helps understanding of the relationship between the disease trans-mission and influencing factors.
