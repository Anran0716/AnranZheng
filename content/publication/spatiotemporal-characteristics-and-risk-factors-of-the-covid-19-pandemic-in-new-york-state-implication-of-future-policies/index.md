  The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading in New York State
  since March 2020, posing health and socioeconomic threats to many areas.
  Statistics of daily confirmed cases and deaths in New York State have been
  growing and declining amid changing policies and environmental factors. Based
  on the county-level COVID-19 cases and environmental factors in the state from
  March to December 2020, this study investigates spatiotemporal clustering
  patterns using spatial autocorrelation and space-time scan analysis.
  Environmental factors influencing the COVID-19 spread were analyzed based on
  the Geodetector model. Infection clusters first appeared in southern New York
  State and then moved to the central western parts as the epidemic developed.
  The statistical results of space-time scan analysis are consistent with those
  of spatial autocorrelation analysis. The analysis results of Geodetector
  showed that both temperature and population density were strong indications of
  the monthly incidence of COVID-19, especially in March and April 2020. There
  is a trend of increasing interactions between various risk factors. This study
  explores the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 in New York State over ten
  months and explains the relationship between the disease transmission and
  influencing factors.
